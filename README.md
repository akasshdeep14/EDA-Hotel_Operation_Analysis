1. The Revenue Management Perspective
Focus: Optimizing ADR, dynamic pricing, and financial stability. This analysis of the Hotel Harmony dataset identifies the primary drivers of profitability and revenue leakage. While City Hotels dominate in volume, Resort Hotels offer the highest yield during peak seasons, suggesting a need for a dual-track pricing strategy. The study highlights a critical correlation between long lead times and high cancellation rates, proposing that the hotel implement tiered deposit structures and dynamic ADR adjustments to protect against last-minute losses. By aligning pricing with guest composition and seasonal demand, Hotel Harmony can maximize its Average Daily Rate while stabilizing its booking pipeline.

2. The Operational & Risk Mitigation Brief
Focus: Cancellations, lead times, and capacity planning. This project provides a data-driven diagnosis of booking volatility within the Hotel Harmony portfolio. The findings reveal that "High-Lead" bookings (reservations made far in advance) are the most significant risk to inventory stability. To combat this, the study recommends shifting toward stricter cancellation policies and incentivizing partial prepayments for early bookers. Additionally, the data suggests that operational efficiency can be improved by leveraging seasonal demand patterns for better staffing and capacity management, ensuring that service quality remains high during periods of peak occupancy.

3. The Guest Experience & Loyalty Narrative
Focus: Personalization, satisfaction, and commitment. The Hotel Harmony study demonstrates that guest commitment is deeply tied to the level of service personalization. Data shows that guests who engage with the hotel through special requests and service customization are significantly less likely to cancel their stays. This insight suggests that "customization is a retention tool." By encouraging guests to personalize their experience at the point of booking, Hotel Harmony can simultaneously increase guest satisfaction scores and reduce booking churn. The result is a more loyal guest base and a more predictable revenue stream.
