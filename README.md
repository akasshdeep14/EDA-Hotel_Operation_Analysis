### Hotel Operation Dataset Analysis Summary

The Hotel Harmony dataset analysis uncovers actionable insights into booking patterns, cancellations, and revenue optimization for city and resort hotels. These findings support strategic adjustments in pricing, policies, and guest services to boost profitability and satisfaction.

## What I Did

Data Cleaning & Standardisation: I processed a dataset containing details for "City Hotels" and "Resort Hotels." This involved handling missing values, identifying outliers in pricing (Average Daily Rate), and ensuring data types were correct for time-series analysis.

Booking Demand Analysis: I analyzed booking patterns to show that City Hotels attract a higher volume of bookings due to location convenience, whereas Resort Hotels see significant seasonal spikes.

Cancellation Predictive Insights: I investigated the factors driving cancellations. I found that long lead times (booking far in advance) and low deposit types were primary indicators of a higher likelihood of cancellation.

Pricing & Revenue Optimization: I tracked the Average Daily Rate (ADR) across different seasons and guest compositions. I discovered how pricing fluctuates based on the number of guests and family-focused trends.

Operational Service Evaluation: I correlated special requests with booking stability, finding that guests who ask for more personalized services are less likely to cancel their stay.

## Tools I Used

Python: The primary language used for all data processing and logical flows.

Pandas & NumPy: I used these for data manipulation, cleaning, and complex aggregations (such as calculating ADR per season).

Matplotlib & Seaborn: I utilized these libraries to create visualizations like line charts for seasonal demand and bar charts for cancellation factors.

Hotel Type Differences -

City Hotels draw higher booking volumes thanks to prime locations and business demand. Resort Hotels yield greater revenue per stay, particularly in peak seasons, making them ideal for premium pricing strategies. This split guides targeted marketing and capacity allocation.

Cancellation Drivers -

Long lead times and modifiable bookings spike cancellation rates, as early reservations often face life changes. Low-deposit options further encourage no-shows, suggesting partial payments or tighter policies for advance bookings. Special requests correlate with lower churn, signaling that personalization fosters commitment.

Pricing and Trends - 

Average Daily Rate (ADR) varies by season, guest type (e.g., families), and market segments, advocating dynamic adjustments. Peak demand calls for promotions and planning, while off-peak focuses on value adds. These patterns, drawn from standard hospitality benchmarks like ADR and RevPAR, enable loyalty-building and loss reduction.
