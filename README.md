### Hotel Operation Dataset Analysis Summary

The Hotel Harmony dataset analysis uncovers actionable insights into booking patterns, cancellations, and revenue optimization for city and resort hotels. These findings support strategic adjustments in pricing, policies, and guest services to boost profitability and satisfaction.

Hotel Type Differences -

City Hotels draw higher booking volumes thanks to prime locations and business demand. Resort Hotels yield greater revenue per stay, particularly in peak seasons, making them ideal for premium pricing strategies. This split guides targeted marketing and capacity allocation.

Cancellation Drivers -

Long lead times and modifiable bookings spike cancellation rates, as early reservations often face life changes. Low-deposit options further encourage no-shows, suggesting partial payments or tighter policies for advance bookings. Special requests correlate with lower churn, signaling that personalization fosters commitment.

Pricing and Trends - 

Average Daily Rate (ADR) varies by season, guest type (e.g., families), and market segments, advocating dynamic adjustments. Peak demand calls for promotions and planning, while off-peak focuses on value adds. These patterns, drawn from standard hospitality benchmarks like ADR and RevPAR, enable loyalty-building and loss reduction.
